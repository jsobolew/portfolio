## CuValley 2022
The task was to estimate the temperature of a special copper smelting furnace. We managed to predict temperature very well. We were finalists, we had the best score in terms of metrics, team with GUI won #JustHackathonThings. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## SuperVisionHack 2022
We proposed a method that automatically scraped information about investment funds in Poland. We created an algorithm that found the fund's strategy and compared it to the fund's quarterly snapshot of its portfolio to asses if the fund sticks to its investment policy and if the risk level assigned is adequate. We were finalists.

## CuValley 2023
We were given a task to estimate the water level in a river. Our solution had: a frontend, backend and machine learning model. Model estimated river level pretty accurately, we had a nice frontend connected to the backend with a model and database showcasing the result of our work. Surprisingly we didn't win. However, we found some very nice correlations between soil type and how long it takes water to flow into the river. We were also able to quantify it using the ML model.
